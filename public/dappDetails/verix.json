As a pioneering bot, VeriX enables group administrators to restrict member additions based on configurable criteria, such as holdings of CKB, xUDT tokens (CKB’s standard for fungible tokens), and NFT tokens. Leveraging CKB’s secure Layer 1 and UTXO-based Cell model, VeriX ensures trustless verification of asset ownership, fostering secure and exclusive communities within the Nervos ecosystem. By facilitating token-gated access, VeriX supports the growth of CKB projects, including DeFi and NFT initiatives, by ensuring only qualified participants join project-related Telegram groups.",
