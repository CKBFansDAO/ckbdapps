  "name": "DotBit",
  "description": "DotBit is a decentralized, cross-chain account and digital identity (DID) protocol built on the Nervos CKB blockchain. It provides a globally unique naming system with a .bit suffix (e.g., imac.bit), enabling users to register and manage accounts that function across multiple blockchains for use cases like cryptocurrency transfers, domain name resolution, and identity authentication. Unlike traditional domain systems like DNS or Ethereum’s ENS, .bit is highly interoperable, allowing users to use any public chain address (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, or TRON) or even an email as the owner or manager of a .bit account. Powered by Nervos CKB’s secure Layer 1 infrastructure, .bit leverages smart contracts (Lock Scripts and Type Scripts) to define account operations and supports flexible record types for diverse data storage. Its ecosystem includes resolution services, client SDKs, and DApp interfaces, fostering integration with wallets, marketplaces, and Web3 applications. By offering a user-friendly, blockchain-agnostic identity solution, .bit aims to simplify Web3 interactions and enhance decentralized identity management.",
